Abstract O

It O
has O
long O
been O
appreciated O
that O
genetic O
analysis O
of O
fetal O
or O
trophoblast O
cells O
in O
maternal O
blood O
could O
revolutionize O
prenatal O
diagnosis O
. O

We O
implemented O
a O
protocol O
for O
single O
circulating O
trophoblast O
( O
SCT O
) O
testing O
using O
positive O
selection O
by O
magnetic-activated O
cell O
sorting O
and O
single-cell O
low-coverage O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
to O
detect O
fetal O
aneuploidies O
and O
copy-number O
variants O
( O
CNVs O
) O
at O
∼1 O
Mb O
resolution O
. O

In O
95 O
validation O
cases O
, O
we O
identified O
on O
average O
0.20 O
putative O
trophoblasts/mL O
, O
of O
which O
55% O
were O
of O
high O
quality O
and O
scorable O
for O
both O
aneuploidy O
and O
CNVs O
. O

We O
emphasize O
the O
importance O
of O
analyzing O
individual O
cells O
because O
some O
cells O
are O
apoptotic O
, O
in O
S-phase O
, O
or O
otherwise O
of O
poor O
quality O
. O

When O
two O
or O
more O
high-quality O
trophoblast O
cells O
were O
available O
for O
singleton O
pregnancies O
, O
there O
was O
complete O
concordance O
between O
all O
trophoblasts O
unless O
there O
was O
evidence O
of O
confined O
placental O
mosaicism O
. O

SCT O
results O
were O
highly O
concordant O
with O
available O
clinical O
data O
from O
chorionic O
villus O
sampling O
( O
CVS O
) O
or O
amniocentesis O
procedures O
. O

Although O
determining O
the O
exact O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
will O
require O
more O
data O
, O
this O
study O
further O
supports O
the O
potential O
for O
SCT O
testing O
to O
become O
a O
diagnostic O

Introduction O

Circulating O
cells O
from O
the O
fetus O
or O
placenta O
in O
a O
pregnant O
woman’s O
blood—primarily O
trophoblasts O
and O
nucleated O
fetal O
red O
blood O
cells O
(fnRBCs)—have O
long O
been O
appreciated O
as O
potential O
targets O
for O
noninvasive O
prenatal O
testing O
( O
NIPT O
) O
and O
diagnosis O
. O

Upon O
isolation O
, O
these O
cells O
provide O
a O
pure O
source O
of O
fetal O
genomic O
DNA O
, O
whereas O
in O
the O
current O
fetal O
cell-free O
DNA O
(cfDNA)-based O
test O
(“cell-free O
NIPT”) O
the O
fetal O
fraction O
only O
contributes O
5% O
to O
20% O
of O
the O
total O
cfDNA O
, O
thus O
hindering O
the O
resolution O
, O
specificity O
, O
and O
utility O
of O
the O
test O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
several O
factors O
, O
such O
as O
maternal O
malignancies O
, O
maternal O
chromosomal O
mosaicism O
, O
maternal O
copy-number O
variants O
(CNVs) O
, O
maternal O
body O
mass O
index O
(BMI) O
, O
and O
maternal O
organ O
transplants O
, O
can O
substantially O
affect O
the O
data O
. O

This O
can O
compromise O
the O
test O
result O
, O
leading O
to O
false-positive O
aneuploidy O
or O
CNV O
results O
and O
, O
more O
rarely O
, O
false-negative O
results.1 O
, O
2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
Hence O
, O
cell-free O
NIPT O
is O
considered O
a O
screening O
test O
requiring O
diagnostic O
confirmation O
, O
whereas O
cell-based O
NIPT O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
become O
a O
diagnostic O
test O
. O



The O
primary O
challenge O
for O
cell-based O
NIPT O
is O
that O
the O
target O
cells O
are O
exceedingly O
rare O
at O
1–2 O
cells/mL O
maternal O
blood,5 O
and O
there O
is O
considerable O
inter-individual O
variability O
in O
the O
number O
of O
recoverable O
cells O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
relative O
scarcity O
of O
these O
cells O
makes O
their O
isolation O
process O
challenging O
, O
we O
and O
others O
have O
previously O
published O
evidence O
for O
the O
feasibility O
of O
trophoblast-based O
NIPT O
for O
fetal O
CNV O
diagnosis.6 O

Although O
much O
of O
our O
work O
has O
utilized O
a O
maternal-white-blood-cell-depletion O
method O
to O
enrich O
for O
target-cell O
candidates,6,9 O
we O
have O
also O
collaborated O
on O
a O
positive O
enrichment O
strategy O
using O
magnetic-activated O
cell O
sorting O
(MACS).7 O
In O
this O
report O
, O
we O
have O
returned O
to O
positive O
selection O
with O
MACS O
. O

We O
found O
that O
the O
positive O
selection O
method O
was O
simpler O
and O
recovered O
slightly O
greater O
numbers O
of O
trophoblasts O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
have O
performed O
the O
largest O
study O
to O
date O
and O
two O
validation O
studies O
in O
which O
this O
positive O
trophoblast O
selection O
was O
applied O
serially O
to O
a O
set O
of O
maternal O
venous O
blood O
samples O
that O
were O
subsequently O
analyzed O
by O
whole-genome O
sequencing O
for O
genome-wide O
CNV O
analysis O
. O

Given O
the O
potential O
variation O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
singlecells,9 O
we O
opted O
to O
analyze O
each O
cell O
individually O
, O
unless O
they O
were O
present O
in O
a O
cell O
cluster O
that O
did O
not O
dissociate O
during O
the O
cell-picking O
process O
. O

Clusters O
include O
doublets O
where O
the O
two O
cells O
often O
appear O
as O
pairs O
of O
mirror O
images O
, O
possibly O
being O
two O
daughter O
cells O
from O
a O
recent O
cell O
division O
. O

Some O
higher-order O
clusters O
were O
seen O
, O
and O
we O
assume O
that O
these O
cell O
clusters O
came O
free O
of O
the O
placenta O
as O
a O
cluster O
as O
opposed O
to O
having O
been O
formed O
as O
aggregates O
while O
in O
the O
circulation O
. O

This O
also O
allows O
for O
adequate O
genotyping O
to O
confirm O
the O
fetal O
origin O
of O
each O
cell O
and O
to O
potentially O
distinguish O
different O
genetic O
signatures O
in O
twin O
or O
higher-multiple O
pregnancies O
or O
in O
the O
case O
of O
confined O
placental O
mosaicism O
. O

Hence O
, O
we O
refer O
to O
our O
assay O
as O
single O
circulating O
trophoblast O
( O
SCT O
) O
testing O
hereafter O

Quality O

Single-cell O
sequencing O
data O
can O
vary O
considerably O
in O
terms O
of O
quality O
. O

We O
found O
some O

to O
be O
in O
a O

indicative O
of O
apoptosis O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
their O

As O
reported O
previously,9 O
apoptotic O

have O
widely O
variable O

such O
that O
there O
are O
chromosomes O
with O
2 O

1 O

This O

Additionally O
, O
the O

that O

We O
interpreted O

a O

Confined O
Placental O
Mosaicism O

As O
stated O
above O
, O
we O
found O
three O
instances O
of O
likely O
confined O
placental O
mosaicism O
( O
CPM O
) O
over O
the O
course O
of O
these O
two O
studies O
. O

For O
subject O
NIPT1309 O
, O
the O
cell-free O
DNA-based O
screening O
test O
was O
positive O
for O
trisomy O
13 O
, O
whereas O
the O
follow-up O
CVS O
(both O
direct O
and O
cultured O
cells) O
showed O
a O
normal O
46,XY O
profile O
by O
karyotype O
and O
chromosomal O
microarray O
(CMA) O
. O

Ultrasound O
examination O
did O
not O
show O
any O
fetal O
abnormalities O
. O

The O
two O
trophoblast O
cells O
that O
were O
isolated O
from O
the O
SCT O
sample O
both O
showed O
a O
trisomy O
13 O
profile O
. O

In O
a O
second O
pregnancy O
, O
NIPT1449 O
(Figure O
S2A) O
, O
the O
cell-free O
DNA-based O
test O
had O
indicated O
“an O

for O
monosomy O

Subsequent O
chromosome O

on O

CVS O

CVS O
showed O
a O
normal O
46,XX O

, O
and O
no O
follow-up O
amniocentesis O
was O
performed O
. O

No O
abnormal O

on O

were O
reported O
. O

The O
seven O
scorable O
trophoblasts O
isolated O
from O
two O
different O
SCT O

samples O
indicated O
a O
mosaic O
result: O
four O
showed O
a O
normal O
46,XX O

, O
whereas O
the O
other O
three O
cells O
showed O
a O
45,X O

. O

It O
is O
of O
interest O
to O
note O
that O
an O
unusual O
number O
of O
poor-quality O
cells O
were O
found O
for O
this O
pregnancy: O
of O
those O
seven O
scorable O
cells O
, O
only O
four O
were O
of O
high O
quality O
, O
and O
another O
three O
were O
only O
scorable O
for O
aneuploidies O
. O

The O
remaining O
six O
cells O
were O
not O
scorable O
. O

For O
another O
sample O
(NIPT1489; O
Figure O

, O
an O
unequivocal O
trisomy O
15 O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
only O
trophoblast O
doublet O
obtained O
. O

The O
cell-free O
DNA-based O

showed O
a O
normal O
result O
, O
as O
did O
the O
amniocentesis O
analysis O
(direct O

performed) O
. O

Several O
fetal O
anomalies O
, O
including O

and O
hydrocephalus O
, O
were O
noted O
on O

CNV O
Resolution O

There O
were O
no O
pregnancies O
involving O
a O
clinically O

pathogenic O
CNV O
in O
these O

. O

Several O
benign O
CNVs O
frequently O
seen O
in O

and O
repetitive O
regions O
around O
centromeres O
were O
reproducibly O
detected O
with O
our O

. O

For O
purposes O
of O
quality O

, O
we O
spiked O
into O

For O

Discussion O

The O
isolation O
and O
analysis O
of O
single O
circulating O
fetal O
or O
trophoblast O
cells O
could O
revolutionize O
the O
field O
of O
prenatal O
diagnosis O
because O
these O
cells O
offer O
an O
optimal O
source O
of O
fetal O
DNA O
. O

Although O
they O
are O
considered O
rare O
cells O
, O
multiple O
proof-of-principle O
publications O
have O
shown O
the O
value O
and O
feasibility O
of O
cell-based O
NIPT.6 O
, O
7 O
, O
8 O
In O
performing O
two O
SCT-testing O
validation O
studies O
, O
we O
report O
a O
yield O
of O
identified O
trophoblasts O
as O
1.62 O
fully O
scorable O
cells/sample O
for O
the O
first O
sample O
series O
and O
2.43 O
high-quality O
cells/sample O
for O
the O
second O
study O
. O

For O
these O
two O
studies O
, O
the O
downward O
trend O
in O
trophoblast O
recovery O
with O
increasing O
gestational O
age O
was O
found O
to O
be O
statistically O
significant O
. O

The O
increase O
in O
trophoblasts O
at O
an O
earlier O
gestational O
age O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
process O
of O
trophoblast O
invasion’s O
leading O
to O
necessary O
uterine O
vascular O
remodeling O
during O
pregnancy.11 O
These O
invading O
trophoblasts O
enter O
the O
maternal O
veins O
and O
might O
in O
this O
manner O
end O
up O
in O
the O
maternal O
circulation.12 O
The O
trophoblast O
invasion O
process O
starts O
around O
6–8 O
weeks O
of O
gestation O
and O
is O
generally O
completed O
by O
19 O
or O
20 O
weeks O
of O
gestation,11 O
hence O
possibly O
leading O
to O
a O
decreased O
trophoblast O
yield O
at O
a O
later O
gestational O
age O
. O

No O
significant O
correlation O
between O
maternal O
age O
and O
trophoblast O
yield O
was O
seen O
, O
and O
maternal O
BMI O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
yield O
significantly; O
in O
contrast O
, O
a O
stronger O
negative O
correlation O
with O
BMI O
was O
seen O
with O
cell-free O
DNA-based O
testing,3 O
although O
a O
slight O
downward O
trend O
in O
the O
number O
of O
trophoblasts O
was O
noted O
with O
increasing O
BMI O
. O

Another O
study O
also O
found O
a O
very O
weak O
trend O
toward O
lower O
cell O
numbers O
as O
BMI O
increased.13 O
Those O
authors O
concluded O
that O
“cell-based O
NIPT O
should O
not O
be O
hampered O
by O
an O
increased O
BMI.” O
The O
much-reduced O
effect O
of O
BMI O
on O
test O
performance O
is O
an O
important O
potential O
advantage O
of O
SCT O
testing O
over O
cell-free O
NIPT O
. O



Focusing O
on O
the O
analysis O
of O
single O
trophoblast O
cells O
, O
we O
can O
learn O
several O
lessons O
from O
these O
studies O
. O

First O
, O
as O
we O
have O
shown O
before,9 O
it O
is O
critical O
to O
analyze O
each O
trophoblast O
individually O
because O
the O
quality O
of O
single O
cells O
can O
vary O
substantially O
. O

Some O
cells O
are O
in O
an O
apoptotic O
state O
involving O
genome-wide O
degradation O
and O
loss O
of O
chromosome O
arms O
or O
whole O
chromosomes O
. O

Apoptosis O
of O
trophoblasts O
in O
the O
maternal O
circulation O
is O
well O
described,14 O
and O
there O
was O
little O
way O
to O
anticipate O
what O
the O
frequency O
might O
be O
. O

Pooling O
apoptotic O
cells O
with O
high-quality O
trophoblasts O
prior O
to O
amplification O
would O
severely O
impact O
the O
overall O
result.9 O
Additionally O
, O
a O
few O
percent O
of O
cells O
are O
found O
to O
be O
in O
S O
phase O
, O
which O
also O
results O
in O
a O
disturbed O
whole-genome O
pattern O
because O
some O
parts O
of O
the O
genome O
will O
already O
have O
replicated O
before O
other O
parts O
, O
and O
the O
non-replicated O
regions O
can O
be O
misinterpreted O
as O
deletions O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
has O
been O
described O
earlier O
by O
Dimitriadou O
et O
al.,15 O
who O
concluded O
that O
a O
cell’s O
being O
in O
S O
phase O
can O
interfere O
with O
accurate O
CNV O
calling O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
preimplantation O
genetic O
diagnosis O
. O

They O
illustrated O
that O
duplications O
from O
9 O
to O
25 O
Mb O
and O
deletions O
of O
8 O
Mb O
were O
potentially O
missed O
in O
this O
scenario O
. O

Our O
results O
agree O
that O
these O
cells O
are O
inadequate O
for O
reliable O
CNV O
calling O
by O
NGS O
, O
but O
we O
found O
that O
S-phase O
cells O
are O
often O
still O
scorable O
for O
aneuploidy O
calling O
, O
as O
was O
seen O
in O
several O
of O
our O
trisomy O
cases O
(Figure O
S1) O
. O

The O
preliminary O
validation O
studies O
performed O
here O
demonstrate O
that O
it O
is O
feasible O
to O
obtain O
multiple O
trophoblasts O
scorable O
for O
both O
aneuploidy O
and O
CNVs O
in O
more O
than O
half O
of O
all O
pregnancies O
tested O
. O

In O
the O
second O
study O
, O
which O
involved O
drawing O
40 O
mL O
of O
maternal O
blood O
, O
two O
or O
more O
scorable O
cells O
were O
recovered O
in O
57% O
of O
all O
pregnancies O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
for O
singleton O
pregnancies O
for O
which O
more O
than O
five O
cells O
were O
obtained O
, O
we O
did O
not O
perform O
NGS O
analysis O
on O
more O
than O
five O
cells O
. O

A O
central O
question O
is O
what O
number O
of O
scorable O
cells O
might O
represent O
an O
adequate O
result O
for O
clinical O
interpretation O
and O
a O
lab O
report O
. O

Although O
we O
began O
with O
a O
goal O
of O
three O
to O
five O
scorable O
cells O
per O
sample O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
multiple O
pregnancies O
yielded O
only O
one O
, O
two O
, O
or O
occasionally O
zero O
high-quality O
cells—this O
remains O
an O
important O
limitation O
of O
our O
test O
. O

However O
, O
based O
on O
the O
very O
high O
concordance O
of O
multiple O
cells O
from O
individual O
singleton O
pregnancies O
, O
we O
become O
relatively O
confident O
of O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
clinical O
interpretation O
when O
two O
cells O
are O
found O
scorable O
by O
two O
independent O
, O
blinded O
, O
board-certified O
reviewers O
with O
full O
agreement O
on O
the O
conclusions O
. O

This O
does O
not O
rule O
out O
mosaicism O
. O



Second O
, O
adequate O
genotyping O
of O
each O
trophoblast O
is O
essential O
. O

Despite O
our O
extensive O
experience O
and O
the O
application O
of O
strict O
criteria O
for O
trophoblast O
candidate O
selection O
by O
microscopy O
, O
occasionally O
a O
putative O
trophoblast O
cell O
was O
found O
to O
be O
of O
maternal O
origin O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
a O
male O
fetus O
, O
the O
confirmation O
is O
straightforward O
because O
an O
XY O
profile O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
whole O
genome O
plot O
obtained O
for O
CNV O
analysis O
, O
and O
94% O
of O
all O
analyzed O
cells O
from O
a O
known O
male O
fetus O
were O
confirmed O
to O
be O
male O
. O

For O
female O
fetuses O
, O
single O
trophoblast O
genotyping O
needs O
to O
be O
built O
into O
the O
workflow O
so O
that O
that O
all O
analyzed O
cells O
are O
guaranteed O
to O
be O
of O
fetal O
origin O
. O

Of O
note O
, O
the O
probability O
that O
putative O
trophoblasts O
are O
of O
true O
fetal O
origin O
is O
higher O
when O
the O
cells O
appear O
in O
clusters O
, O
and O
we O
usually O
did O
not O
see O
these O
clusters O
for O
maternal O
cells O
. O



Third O
, O
the O
results O
of O
analysis O
of O
multiple O
cells O
from O
the O
same O
pregnancy O
are O
remarkably O
consistent O
unless O
there O
is O
evidence O
of O
placental O
mosaicism O
or O
a O
multiple O
pregnancy O
. O

The O
ability O
of O
SCT O
testing O
to O
detect O
various O
forms O
of O
mosaicism O
is O
an O
important O
consideration O
. O

There O
are O
three O
types O
of O
CPM O
(types O
I O
, O
II O
, O
and O
III) O
and O
three O
types O
of O
true O
fetal O
mosaicism O
( O
TFM O
) O
(types O
IV O
, O
V O
, O
and O
VI);16 O
types O
I O
and O
II O
are O
the O
most O
common O
forms O
of O
CPM O
overall O
. O

CPM O
is O
not O
always O
benign; O
in O
a O
recent O
study O
on O
types O
II O
and O
III O
, O
the O
latter O
was O
found O
to O
be O
significantly O
associated O
with O
preterm O
births O
, O
newborns O
who O
were O
small O
for O
their O
gestational O
age O
, O
and O
adverse O
pregnancy O
outcomes.17 O
Both O
types O
II O
and O
V O
involve O
mesenchymal O
cells O
only O
and O
would O
thus O
not O
be O
detected O
by O
our O
SCT O
assay O
, O
which O
only O
examines O
cytotrophoblastic O
cells O
. O

In O
our O
95-sample O
series O
, O
we O
encountered O
three O
instances O
of O
likely O
CPM O
, O
and O
these O
were O
most O
compatible O
with O
type O
I O
CPM O
. O

In O
two O
of O
those O
pregnancies O
there O
was O
independent O
evidence O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
CPM O
from O
other O
clinical O
results O
. O

For O
the O
third O
pregnancy O
, O
we O
interpret O
the O
recovery O
of O
the O
only O
cell O
showing O
trisomy O
15 O
from O
a O
pregnancy O
with O
a O
normal O
cell-free O
NIPT O
and O
amniocentesis O
outcome O
as O
most O
likely O
originating O
from O
low-level O
CPM O
. O

Although O
mosaicism O
overall O
is O
detected O
in O
about O
2% O
of O
CVS O
analyses O
and O
1% O
for O
CPM O
type O
I O
specifically O
, O
the O
gestational O
age O
and O
the O
number O
of O
cells O
studied O
can O
affect O
detection O
rates O
. O

Hence O
, O
in O
this O
situation O
, O
pursuing O
a O
confirmatory O
CVS O
or O
amniocentesis O
would O
be O
recommended O
. O

The O
time O
frame O
for O
SCT O
testing O
, O
however O
, O
is O
of O
great O
advantage O
because O
it O
can O
be O
done O
early O
enough O
in O
the O
pregnancy O
to O
allow O
ample O
time O
for O
follow-up O
testing O
. O

Several O
samples O
collected O
at O
10 O
weeks O
of O
gestation O
or O
earlier O
were O
included O
in O
this O
study O
and O
produced O
satisfactory O
results O
, O
and O
we O
are O
currently O
collecting O
more O
samples O
as O
early O
as O
6 O
or O
7 O
weeks O
of O
gestational O
age O
. O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
note O
that O
other O
factors O
, O
such O
as O
ultrasound O
examination O
, O
will O
help O
in O
evaluating O
a O
SCT O
test O
result O
. O



Fourth O
, O
the O
analysis O
of O
multiple O
pregnancies O
can O
prove O
a O
challenging O
task O
, O
but O
SCT O
testing O
has O
advantages O
over O
cell-free O
DNA-based O
NIPT O
because O
each O
fetus O
can O
be O
tested O
separately O
. O

Although O
, O
in O
general O
, O
a O
higher O
number O
of O
trophoblasts O
is O
obtained O
for O
multiples O
, O
this O
does O
not O
guarantee O
recovery O
of O
cells O
from O
all O
fetuses O
. O

If O
twins O
are O
of O
opposite O
sexes O
, O
it O
is O
straightforward O
to O
determine O
which O
cells O
are O
from O
which O
fetus O
. O

Although O
for O
three O
out O
of O
the O
five O
opposite-sex O
twin O
pregnancies O
described O
here O
cells O
from O
both O
twins O
were O
analyzed O
, O
for O
the O
two O
other O
pregnancies O
data O
were O
available O
for O
only O
one O
fetus O
, O
indicating O
that O
more O
method O
improvements O
for O
twin O
analysis O
are O
necessary O
. O

Our O
current O
method O
is O
also O
limited O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
zygosity O
of O
the O
multiples O
is O
not O
determined O
and O
that O
it O
is O
not O
always O
possible O
to O
track O
from O
which O
fetus O
a O
certain O
trophoblast O
originated O
(e.g. O
, O
when O
both O
twins O
are O
of O
the O
same O
sex O
and/or O
when O
no O
obvious O
ultrasound O
findings O
can O
give O
any O
indication) O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
SCT O
testing O
can O
still O
offer O
valuable O
information O
on O
twin O
and O
multiple O
pregnancies O
because O
each O
trophoblast O
is O
analyzed O
and O
evaluated O
separately O
. O

A O
DNA O
sample O
from O
the O
father O
is O
not O
needed O
for O
SCT O
testing O
unless O
there O
is O
a O
question O
of O
whether O
a O
finding O
in O
the O
fetus O
is O
de O
novo O
or O
inherited O
. O



Finally O
, O
our O
method O
allows O
reliable O
detection O
of O
CNVs O
down O
to O
1 O
Mb O
in O
size O
, O
as O
we O
illustrated O
previously,9 O
and O
is O
here O
confirmed O
again O
by O
the O
detection O
of O
small O
, O
benign O
, O
recurrent O
CNVs O
(Figure O
4) O
. O

Although O
these O
pericentromeric O
repetitive O
sequences O
are O
often O
excluded O
in O
microarrays O
, O
these O
regions O
were O
included O
in O
the O
NGS O
analysis O
if O
reads O
could O
be O
uniquely O
mapped O
in O
the O
genome O
. O

We O
have O
also O
shown O
that O
the O
use O
of O
spiked-in O
single O
lymphoblast O
cells O
can O
be O
very O
helpful O
for O
quality O
assurance O
regarding O
detection O
of O
CNVs O
of O
various O
sizes O
. O



It O
is O
difficult O
to O
compare O
these O
results O
to O
the O
National O
Institute O
of O
Child O
Health O
and O
Human O
Development O
Fetal O
Cell O
Isolation O
Study O
( O
NIFTY O
) O
study O
from O
17 O
years O
ago.18 O
That O
study O
focused O
on O
fetal O
nucleated O
red O
blood O
cells O
and O
fluorescence O
in O
situ O
hybridization O
( O
FISH O
) O
detection O
of O
aneuploidy O
, O
whereas O
this O
study O
focuses O
on O
trophoblasts O
and O
detection O
of O
CNVs O
down O
to O
1–2 O
Mb O
. O

Putting O
aside O
these O
major O
differences O
, O
the O
NIFTY O
study O
found O
“at O
least O
one O
aneuploid O
cell O
in O
74.4% O
of O
cases O
of O
fetal O
aneuploidy,” O
whereas O
this O
study O
found O
at O
least O
one O
aneuploid O
cell O
in O
100% O
of O
affected O
fetuses O
. O



The O
results O
from O
SCT O
testing O
are O
all-or-none O
conclusions O
, O
such O
as O
whether O
a O
particular O
aneuploidy O
or O
pathogenic O
CNV O
is O
present O
or O
absent O
in O
the O
cell O
being O
analyzed O
. O

This O
is O
similar O
to O
cytogenetic O
chromosomal O
microarray O
data O
and O
can O
thus O
be O
considered O
a O
qualitative O
result O
, O
more O
characteristic O
of O
a O
diagnostic O
test O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
cell-free O
NIPT O
can O
only O
provide O
a O
probability O
that O
a O
particular O
aneuploidy O
or O
pathogenic O
CNV O
is O
present O
or O
absent O
, O
and O
this O
limited O
ability O
is O
more O
characteristic O
of O
a O
screening O
test O
. O



We O
have O
mentioned O
a O
number O
of O
limitations O
, O
including O
the O
inability O
to O
obtain O
high-quality O
data O
for O
multiple O
cells O
from O
every O
fetus O
. O

Some O
cells O
are O
apoptotic O
or O
in O
S O
phase O
, O
but O
because O
all O
cells O
are O
analyzed O
individually O
, O
these O
cells O
do O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
interpretation O
of O
high-quality O
cells O
. O

Although O
the O
request O
was O
to O
draw O
blood O
prior O
to O
CVS O
or O
amniocentesis O
, O
this O
was O
not O
always O
achieved O
in O
the O
busy O
clinic O
environment O
. O

We O
did O
not O
find O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
cell O
recovery O
when O
blood O
was O
drawn O
either O
before O
or O
after O
CVS O
(in O
12 O
cases O
prior O
to O
, O
in O
16 O
after O
CVS) O
or O
amniocentesis O
(12 O
prior O
to O
, O
four O
after) O
, O
but O
the O
number O
of O
samples O
is O
low O
and O
too O
small O
to O
allow O
comparison O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
length O
of O
time O
between O
the O
procedure O
and O
blood O
draw O
. O

The O
detection O
of O
CPM O
can O
bring O
both O
some O
advantages O
and O
some O
disadvantages O
. O

Detecting O
mosaicism O
in O
general O
is O
an O
advantage O
because O
it O
provides O
information O
about O
the O
fetus O
, O
such O
as O
providing O
the O
opportunity O
to O
detect O
uniparental O
disomy O
or O
true O
fetal O
mosaicism O
and O
could O
easily O
be O
followed O
up O
with O
CVS O
and/or O
amniocentesis O
. O

Our O
method O
differs O
from O
CVS O
in O
that O
it O
fails O
to O
detect O
mesenchymal O
CPM O
. O

Although O
the O
current O
higher O
costs O
and O
limited O
throughput O
may O
be O
disadvantages O
initially O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
these O
limitations O
can O
be O
solved O
through O
( O
technical O
) O
improvements O
and O
automation O
. O



Is O
the O
test O
clinically O
useful O
in O
its O
present O
form? O
Opinions O
are O
likely O
to O
differ O
. O

We O
estimate O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
testing O
with O
the O
current O
protocol O
would O
be O
at O
least O
$3,000 O
, O
and O
the O
throughput O
would O
be O
a O
constraint O
. O

We O
expect O
that O
improvements O
could O
lower O
costs O
and O
increase O
throughput O
substantially O
. O

The O
turnaround O
time O
would O
be O
2–3 O
days O
longer O
than O
that O
for O
cell-free O
NIPT O
. O

In O
light O
of O
the O
15.8% O
no-result O
rate O
for O
CNVs O
and O
the O
10.5% O
no-result O
rate O
for O
aneuploidy O
in O
study O
2 O
as O
shown O
in O
Table O
2 O
, O
there O
is O
clear O
need O
for O
improvement O
. O

Any O
test O
failures O
could O
be O
followed O
up O
through O
CVS O
or O
amniocentesis O
. O

Although O
the O
recovery O
of O
two O
or O
more O
high-quality O
cells O
from O
>95% O
of O
fetuses O
would O
make O
the O
test O
more O
ready O
for O
clinical O
use O
, O
even O
in O
its O
current O
form O
it O
could O
be O
an O
attractive O
clinical O
option O
for O
early O
testing O
of O
pregnancies O
at O
high O
risk O
. O



In O
conclusion O
, O
SCT O
analysis O
is O
potentially O
a O
powerful O
tool O
for O
prenatal O
testing O
and O
diagnosis O
. O

We O
are O
optimistic O
that O
the O
recovery O
of O
trophoblasts O
can O
be O
improved O
. O

SCT O
testing O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
deliver O
a O
diagnostic O
result O
instead O
of O
being O
merely O
a O
screening O
test O
if O
an O
adequate O
number O
of O
trophoblast O
cells O
can O
be O
obtained O
for O
every O
sampled O
pregnancy O
. O

A O
longer-term O
goal O
would O
be O
to O
detect O
all O
de O
novo O
point O
mutations O
in O
a O
fetus O
. O
